    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>After reading the article on progressive enhancement, it is clear to see why it is so important. This biggest difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation is that graceful degradation focused on usability in the newest and most advanced browser. On the other hand, progressive enhancement focused on the content. With progressive enhancement, content was the most important feature for the website, that way everyone could use it, no matter how old their browser was. Progressive enhancement is almost like a layer scheme on how to approach the building of a website. The content is the first and most important layer, then the CSS, and then JavaScript. Doing it this way makes it so that everyone can interact with the website in one form or another. </p>
    
    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>As I wrapped up my final project, I was overall pretty satisfied with how it turned out. I let my husband go through the website and make sure all the features worked as they were supposed to. He told me that if he were doing an assignment on SpaceX Dragon, this would be a site that he would believe was a valid source of information for it. 
</p>
    <p>With that in mind, I decided to keep the color schemes and features I had originally created. The only problem I had with the website was trying to center my photos. For some reason, they were jumping to the left of the screen and I couldn’t seem to figure out which part of my code was causing this issue. After emailing Professor Wallace, we were able to figure out the issue, which of course turned out to be something extremely minor, and it fixed the issue immediately.
</p>
    <p>If I can take away anything from this class it would be that right there. When coding, all it takes is one little mistake, even if it’s just something misspelled, to throw off your whole project. It can be time consuming, and it is definitely very detail oriented work, but when your project winds up coming together exactly how you imagined it in the end, it’s worth it. I’m so happy this is my major and can’t wait to learn more next semester.
